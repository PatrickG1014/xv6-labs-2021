## Exercises

- System call tracing
  
  In this assignment you will add a system call tracing feature that may help you when debugging later labs. You'll create a new `trace` system call that will control tracing. It should take one argument, an integer "mask", whose bits specify which system calls to trace. For example, to trace the fork system call, a program calls `trace(1 << SYS_fork)`, where `SYS_fork` is a syscall number from `kernel/syscall.h`. You have to modify the xv6 kernel to print out a line when each system call is about to return, if the system call's number is set in the mask. The line should contain the process id, the name of the system call and the return value; you don't need to print the system call arguments. The `trace` system call should enable tracing for the process that calls it and any children that it subsequently forks, but should not affect other processes.

- Sysinfo
  
  In this assignment you will add a system call, `sysinfo`, that collects information about the running system. The system call takes one argument: a pointer to a `struct sysinfo` (see `kernel/sysinfo.h`). The kernel should fill out the fields of this struct: the `freemem` field should be set to the number of bytes of free memory, and the `nproc` field should be set to the number of processes whose `state` is not `UNUSED`. We provide a test program `sysinfotest`; you pass this assignment if it prints "sysinfotest: OK".

- Optional challenge exercises
  
  - Print the system call arguments for traced system calls (*easy*).
  
  - Compute the load average and export it through sysinfo(*moderate*).
